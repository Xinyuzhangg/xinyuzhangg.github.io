  title={CLRN: A Reasoning Network for multi-relation Question Answering over Cross-lingual Knowledge Graphs},
  author={Yiming Tan, Xinyu Zhang, Yongrui Chen, Guilin Qi, Yuncheng Hua},
  abstract={Cross-lingual Knowledge Graph-based Question Answering (CLKGQA) requires the question answering (QA) system to combine the knowledge graphs (KGs) in different languages to obtain answers to input questions. In the past works, the common idea is to combine CLKG into a single KG through an entity alignment (EA) model and then treat it as a single KG-based QA. However, due to the error transmission caused by the alignment model, the QA results are not good enough. This paper proposes a novel reasoning network named CLRN, which regards the reasoning process as a combination of multiple one-hop reasoning to switch KG at any step of reasoning. This enables CLRN to make reasoning in different directions between CLKG. Furthermore, we set up an iterative framework to combine CLRN and EA models and strengthen each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which outperforms the baseline approaches. Through iterative enhancement, the performance of the EA model has also been significantly improved. Moreover, our work discusses the correlation between QA and EA from the side of QA, which has reference value for the follow-up exploration of related communities.},
