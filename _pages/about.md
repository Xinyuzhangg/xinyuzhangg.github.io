Hello, glad to meet you, I am a CS student interested in NLP, operating system, skateboard and coffee making. I am born and raised in Jingmen, Hubei. A small and beautiful city located in the middle of China famous for fish cake and rice.

I love traveling, I have been to Japan, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Czech and the U.S. myself. I enjoy the tranquility brought by the nature when explore the wild and the bustling flowing in the metropolis while knowing more people. I could go on wandering in the mountains the whole day breathing in the fresh air and be immersed in the green the flourishing.

I have an electronic skate board which runs blazingly fast, being on it is like steering the wind.
